# Myo
Data collection application to collect IMU (and in the future, EMG) data from two MYO armbands simultaneously. The goal of this project is 2-fold. It is first a part of my thesis work to collect IMU sensor data from forearms, and also some third party Myo developers have been asking about how to collect IMU sensor data from two Myo armbands simultaneously.

Signal processing and machine learning methods will be implemented elsewhere.
